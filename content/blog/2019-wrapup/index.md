Year end reviews are *so tired* I know but here we are. 2019 was a good year all in all - I worked the same job and lived in the same country/city/home for the whole thing which was so lovely and relaxing compared to 2017/2018. I spent the whole year working remotely which I absolutely love. I did work I'm proud of, continued to learn a bunch from some really great coworkers, took on challenges that were beyond my comfort zone, etc. I travelled to a couple new places like Bavaria, where I could honestly live, and Vegas, which is whack in a way that's fun for about 1.75 days. In March we brought home dog #2, who was shipped up from Texas. She's a purebred mutt or maybe an alien space dog. She is a bit goofy looking (goes well with dog #1 in that respect) and has pointy satellite ears that are always ready to receive messages from her home planet. She's incredibly cute and also incredibly destructive and anyway I'm obsessed with her.

Maybe my favourite thing I did this year though was get a library card and get back into a reading habit. I read tons as a kid but fell out of the habit in university. I read a lot this year (77 books according to [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2019/90618505), which was surprising given how slow I read). This can be partly attributed to spending so many hours/days/weeks(?) of the last year at the dog park, throwing the ball for my obsessive hyperenergetic dog (boring) while reading (less boring). I made a goal near the beginning of the year to read more stuff by non-white-men authors and the results were v good (nothing against y'all white dudes but I've been reading your stuff my whole life!). 

**A book I actually read at the very end of 2018 but is amazing and I think of often still and informed a lot of my reading in 2019:**

**Novels by indigenous authors that blew me away:**

Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance - Robert M Pirsig

There were more that were v good and more that were fine and are all on goodreads somewhere. I have learned that I'm too ADD to plan my reading out in advance so I have no idea what I'll read in 2020 but I'm sure it'll be good and I'll learn from it. Let me know what you read because I truly love talking about books.
